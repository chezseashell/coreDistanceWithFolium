# Core Distance with Folium MapThis project uses Python, Folium, Nominatim and the Skyfield library to calculate the distance from various geographic locations to the Earth's core, based on latitude, longitude, and elevation. The calculated data is then visualized using an interactive Folium map with markers for each city.## Features- Fetches geographic coordinates for a list of cities using the Nominatim API.- Calculates distances to the Earth's core using the Skyfield API.- Visualizes city distances on a Folium map, with color-coded markers based on proximity to the Earth's core. (Orange is the closest and gray is the furthest from the Earth's core)- Displays the map inline in Jupyter Notebook and saves it as an HTML file for sharing.## InstallationTo run this project, you'll need the following:1. Python 3.x2. Required Python libraries:   - `folium`   - `skyfield`   - `requests`   - `geopy`   - `IPython`Install the dependencies using pip:```bashpip install folium skyfield requests geopy ipython
